## Creating releases

insidesales-components uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
to release new versions automatically.

To help with creating commit messages, you can install the [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) command line tools. Once you have the command line tool installed, you can commit your staged changes by running `npm run commit`. This command will trigger the commitizen cli and walk you through creating your commit message for staged changes. Here are a couple of tutorials you can use to check out how this works:

[https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-committing-a-new-feature-with-commitizen](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-committing-a-new-feature-with-commitizen)

If you choose not to use commitizen, please follow the [semantic-release commit message format](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#default-commit-message-format) so releases will trigger properly.

**Use the following types accordingly:**

*  Commits of type `fix` will trigger bugfix releases, think `0.0.1`
*  Commits of type `feat` will trigger feature releases, think `0.1.0`
*  Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in body or footer will trigger breaking releases, think `1.0.0`

All other commit types will trigger no new release.
