### Project setup

Run `npm install` and edit code in the `src/` folder.

To start the project, run `npm start`. This will run the neccesary scripts to build storybooks and start the development server on http://localhost:3001. Running this command will also watch for any changes and update storybooks.

### Deploying to NPM

Starting in the root directory:
1. `npm version major|minor|patch` - Use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) based on changes to the package
2. `npm run build:lib`
3. `cd lib` (we make you cd to lib to avoid accidental publishing from root)
4. `npm publish`

### Deploying storybooks

from the root directory run `npm deploy:docs`
